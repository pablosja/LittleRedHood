<h2 id="chap1">1. Once Upon a Time in Kingston</h2>
<p id="text1">Once upon a time in the land of Kingston, nation of Jamaica, there was a little girl living with her mama. This girl had braids and she also had dreams but more than anything she had a nanny she used to have fun with. Her mama called her Lily Brook, such a pretty name, but she used to hide her look under a little red hood. And that's what she was called too. Then one day it came the day, it was a frantic day that day; her mama was busy and had a lot on her plate. That's why she called Lily Brook, also known as Little Red Hood, to run some errands and help her out.
    Mama said out loud: "Please Lily dear, come over here, let me tell you this chore I need you to do. Here is a pie and here is a basket, put it inside and bring it to Prospect". <br>
    Little Red Hood replied to her: "That's where my sweet nanny dwells!"<br>
    And mommy said: "That's right, go check and see that she is well."<br>
    Little Red Hood wondered: "But isn't that a bad side of town?"<br>
    "Sure is. Here is a gun for you to feel safe. If anyone spooky stalks you around, hesitate not and put him down." - Her mama replied.<br>
    And that's how Little Red Hood left her mama's hearth, following the path her mama drew on her map, to her nanny's house, with an apple pie and a joyful heart.</div> </p>
