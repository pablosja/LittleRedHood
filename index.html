<h2 id="chap1">1. Once Upon a Time in Kingston</h2>
<p id="text1">Once upon a time in the land of Kingston, nation of Jamaica, there was a little girl living with her mama. This girl had braids and she also had dreams but more than anything she had a nanny she used to have fun with. Her mama called her Lily Brook, such a pretty name, but she used to hide her look under a little red hood. And that's what she was called too. Then one day it came the day, it was a frantic day that day; her mama was busy and had a lot on her plate. That's why she called Lily Brook, also known as Little Red Hood, to run some errands and help her out.
    Mama said out loud: "Please Lily dear, come over here, let me tell you this chore I need you to do. Here is a pie and here is a basket, put it inside and bring it to Prospect". <br>
    Little Red Hood replied to her: "That's where my sweet nanny dwells!"<br>
    And mommy said: "That's right, go check and see that she is well."<br>
    Little Red Hood wondered: "But isn't that a bad side of town?"<br>
    "Sure is. Here is a gun for you to feel safe. If anyone spooky stalks you around, hesitate not and put him down." - Her mama replied.<br>
    And that's how Little Red Hood left her mama's hearth, following the path her mama drew on her map, to her nanny's house, with an apple pie and a joyful heart.</div> </p>

    <h2 id="chap2">2. The Big Bad Wolf</h2>
    <p id="text2">People heard a long loud howl somewhere in the area of that Trench Town. People didn't go down there, people knew it was dangerous down there. An entity of darkness 
        and evil lived down there. He was no man, he was no angel. More like a thug, more like a Crook. He was the Big Bad Wolf. Nobody knew what his real name was, they only knew he could stab you with his big sharp claws. The wolf was missing an eye he lost in such unfair fight against a man he knew not, he tried to make him his lunch, but instead by him he got shot. The Wolf lost an eye, and with that eye he lost his sanity as well; lusting for vengeance and going astray. But one lucky day the Big Bad Wolf learned some interesting news. A folk he knew from the riverview snitched and sceamed what the name of that old bastard was. His name was Fred but the man was dead, he died in the war, dying a hero's death saving a fellow comrade from a grenade's blow. The Big Bad Wolf was upset at first, for he could not take revenge on someone who was already dead, but then his friend from the riverview said that this man had a daughter, so the Wolf could kill her instead. The Wolf asked what her name was or what were the looks of her, and his buddy said the her name he knew not, but she was popular for always wearing red. <br>
        "My vengeance is near!" -the Big Bad Wolf yelled with wrath so sheer. He swiftly left Trench Town to follow the trail of that Little Red Hood. He found her scent and followed the smell. He got to a house that smelled like blueberries and cake. The Wolf was sneaky and some chatting overheard. The girl in red was being sent to the town of Prospect, where her grandmother dwelled, to visit and bring her a pie made with whole grain. <br>
        "I see..." -the Big Bad Wolf whispered, plotting a mischievous plan. "I'll run ahead of this Little Red Hood and I'll find her nanny's old crib; I'll give the old lady a big bad spook thus I'll get something to eat."<br>
        And that's how the Big Bad Wolf learned about Little Red Hood, the daughter of the mean man who took his eye and left him half-blind. Soon he'll meet his long-awaited fate, as his only thought in mind was "vengeance shall be mine".</p>
