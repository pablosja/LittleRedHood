    <h2 id="chap1" class="gradient-text1">1. Once Upon a Time in Kingston</h2>
    <p id="text1" class="gradient-text2">Once upon a time in the land of Kingston, nation of Jamaica, there was a little girl living with her mama. This girl had braids and she also had dreams but more than anything she had a nanny she used to have fun with. Her mama called her Lily Brook, such a pretty name, but she used to hide her look under a little red riding hood. And that's what she was called too. Then one day it came the day, it was a frantic day that day; her mama was busy and had a lot on her plate. That's why she called Lily Brook, also known as Little Red Riding Hood, to run some errands and help her out.
        Mama said out loud: "Please Lily dear, come over here, let me tell you this chore I need you to do. Here is a pie and here is a basket, put it inside and bring it to Prospect". <br>
        Little Red Riding Hood replied to her: "That's where my sweet nanny dwells!"<br>
        And mommy said: "That's right, go check and see that she is well."<br>
        Little Red Riding Hood wondered: "But isn't that a bad side of town?"<br>
        "Sure is. Here is a gun for you to feel safe. If anyone spooky stalks you around, hesitate not and put him down." - Her mama replied.<br>
        And that's how Little Red Riding Hood left her mama's hearth, following the path her mama drew on her map, to her nanny's house, with an apple pie and a joyful heart.</div> </p>

    <h2 id="chap2" class="gradient-text1">2. The Big Bad Wolf</h2>
    <p id="text2" class="gradient-text2">People heard a long loud howl somewhere in the area of that Trench Town. People didn't go down there, people knew it was dangerous down there. An entity of darkness 
        and evil lived down there. He was no man, he was no angel. More like a thug, more like a crook. He was the Big Bad Wolf. Nobody knew what his real name was, they only knew he could stab you with his big sharp claws. The wolf was missing an eye he lost in such unfair fight against a man he knew not, he tried to make him his lunch, but instead by him he got shot. The Wolf lost an eye, and with that eye he lost his sanity as well; lusting for vengeance and going astray. But one lucky day the Big Bad Wolf learned some interesting news. A folk he knew from the riverview snitched and screamed what the name of that old bastard was. His name was Fred but the man was dead, he died in the war, dying a hero's death saving a fellow comrade from a grenade's blow. The Big Bad Wolf was upset at first, for he could not take revenge on someone who was already dead, but then his friend from the riverview said that this man had a daughter, so the Wolf could kill her instead. The Wolf asked what her name was or what were the looks of her, and his buddy said the her name he knew not, but she was popular for always wearing red. <br>
        "My vengeance is near!" -the Big Bad Wolf yelled with wrath so sheer. He swiftly left Trench Town to follow the trail of that Little Red Riding Hood. He found her scent and followed the smell. He got to a house that smelled like blueberries and cake. The Wolf was sneaky and some chatting overheard. The girl in red was being sent to the town of Prospect, where her grandmother dwelled, to visit and bring her a pie made with whole grain. <br>
        "I see..." -the Big Bad Wolf whispered, plotting a mischievous plan. "I'll run ahead of this Little Red Riding Hood and I'll find her nanny's old crib; I'll give the old lady a big bad spook thus I'll get something to eat."<br>
        And that's how the Big Bad Wolf learned about Little Red Riding Hood, the daughter of the mean man who took his eye and left him half-blind. Soon he'll meet his long-awaited fate, as his only thought in mind was "vengeance shall be mine".</p>

<div id="nanny">
    <h2 id="chap3" class="gradient-text1">3. The Nanny</h2>
    <p id="text3" class="gradient-text2">There once was a town called Prospect and Kingston was by. There lived an old lady named Molly Anne Lyde. Everyone called her nanny for she was so gentle and nice; such a woman of honor and pride! But this sweet nanny was feeling her age was taking a toll on her, she felt tired quite often and her dishes got broken for her shaky hands couldn't hold them. Everybody loved her in the town of Prospect, so people would come to her doorstep to bring her food, flowers and chocolates. One day she was feeling the weakness that comes with old age, not in the mood of doing chores or cleaning a few dirty spots she found in the corridor. Then she heard the doorbell ring as she often did. She didn't ask who out there was, for she was used to having her neighbors on, so she opened the door as her old jaw dropped to the floor. A big bad wolf was at the threshold of her door, staring at her with his bloodshot eye, and all she could get to say was: "Oh, Lord!"<br>
        The Big Bad Wolf stormed in the house, grabbed her by the neck and snapped it. The sweet old nanny dropped dead on the floor, by the hand of the Big Bad Wolf she was murdered. The Wolf closed the door behind his stead and took the still warm body of the sweet old nanny and hid it inside a closet. The Wolf took some of nanny's clothes and nanny's make-up, he put all of it on and got into nanny's bedrack. The corpse was hidden and his deed so hideous, waiting for Little Red Hood to come over complete his mission.<br>
        The Big Bad Wolf was patiently waiting, he waited so long it felt like ages. Then he perceived the smell of some delicious pie. He knew it was time. The doorbell rang and he felt his blood boiling up. He knew it was Little Red Riding Hood at the door, for the smell was like no other.<br> 
        He yelled in a weak and alterred voice: "Come on in!". The time is here and now, and it's coming down.</p>

<div id="hunter">
    <h2 id="chap4" class="gradient-text1">4. The Hunter</h2>
    <p id="text4" class="gradient-text2">In the overgrown depths of the forest near Prospect there was an old man of name Satchel. He was nothing without his hunting rifle. He used to hunt and he used to provide tasty meats and furry hides to the local folks with a humble smile. He used to hunt deers and he used to hunt boars, and he also caught bunnies with a trap made of planks and stones. <br>
        He was out one day looking for a juicy prey when he heard loud screams coming from a shack closeby. He approached the place with his rifle ready, he knew how to shoot and no trouble was too scary. He heard screams and noises and furniture breaking, like all hell breaking loose inside of that dwelling. He took a look inside through the backyard window and saw an awful sight. <br>
        There was a big bad wolf dressed in old lady rags, chasing a little girl dressed with a red cowl and a red dress and some red shoes.<br>
        The hunter broke in the house through the back door aiming with his rifle at the big bad wolf, the one with big eyes and big ears and big teeth, the one chasing after a little girl trying to get her killed.<br>
        "Stop at once! Move no more or I'll shoot you dead!" - The hunter commanded as both wolf and girl froze in place. <br>
        "What is this mess? Speak now or else!" - The hunter demanded from them. <br>
        "Please my good sir! Save me from this filthy dog that's trying to eat my guts and rip my face!" -Little Red Riding Hood begged.<br>
        "Don't listen to that fiend! She tried to kill me, that little demon dressed in red!" -The wolf said.<br>
        A moment of doubt ran through the hunter's mind, wondering for a second if the wolf was right, but right before he could react, the big bag wolf grabbed his rifle and aimed it back at him.<br>
        "I've got your rifle and also your pride, may you try to run but you shall not hide!" -The wolf said with a victorious smile.<br>
        "Oh no! I am doomed!" - Little Red Riding Hood cried in horror.
        The hunter was moved by the fear he heard in Little Red RidingHood's voice, then he knew what to do. He had no choice. He stood between the girl and the wolf, protecting her from her imminent doom. <br>
        "If you want to kill her you'll have to kill me first!" -The hunter said, knowing he could die right there.<br>
        "Step away, old man, I have no quarrel with your person. Give me the girl and I swear I'll let you go unharmed" -The wolf promised between his teeth.
        Then the wolf held the trigger tight and the hunter knew it was right at that time that he had to try to save that girl's life, so he jumped forth and grabbed the rifle by the cannon, the wolf fired once as he struggled with the hunter and the shot hit furnace. From the furnace the sparks, from the sparks the flame, and from the flame a fire got caught in the curtains of the house. Hell broke loose but the wolf was certain not to lose so he shot again and this time hit the hunter in his hoof.<br>
        The hunter screamed, the hunter yelled out of pain for he had got shot on his leg and he really, really bled. The wolf rushed forth and was about to grab Little Red Riding Hood by the neck, he wanted to kill her the same way he killed her nanny, whose corpse was now burning inside the closet.<br>
        Suddenly the wolf found himself in a situation he could never have foreseen. Little Red Riding Hood reached inside her basket, pulled out a gun and pointed it at his forehead. It was a high caliber pistol being held by an innocent little girl.
        "You rascal! You're just like your father! He took my eye! Kill me first or I shall kill you then!" -The wolf cried with utter anger at the girl.

<div id="end">
    <h2 id="chap5" class="gradient-text1">5. The End</h2>
    <p id="text5" class="gradient-text2"> Then Little Red Riding Hood's expression changed and then she smiled. She smiled so wide she was almost laughing.
            "You lousy and miserable dog. I've known about it all along. I knew you wanted my father dead since he told me he had kicked your bum all those years back. Now my dad is gone but I am here instead. Now look at the bottom of this barrel and meet your end."<br>
            Then the wolf tried to speak but before any word could come out of his mouth a loud bang was heard.<br>
            Thus the hunter saw how this little girl shot that wolf in the head. The wolf was dead and his brains were all splattered on the floor. Then he saw Little Red Riding Hood laughing her lungs out. It was in that moment he realized that little girl was crazy.
            The hunter then begged as he was lying on the floor: "Please sweet miss, help me out of this burning house."<br>
            But Little Red Riding Hood replied: "you silly! don't you get this is all a tale? We don't exist and neither does pain. So have fun and enjoy the flames!"<br>
            The hunter cried for help again: "Please don't let me die here like your nanny. Plase help me!"<br>
            Then Little Red Riding Hood said with a laugh: "oh you dummie! She was not my nanny! She was everybody's nanny! But since she's dead now, I guess that makes her nobody's nanny!"<br>
            And this is how this girl Lily Brook, also known as Little Red Riding Hood, left that house on fire. The flames consumed an old lady with a broken neck, a big bad wolf with a bullet in his head, and a lonely hunter who was bleeding out from a shot on his leg. She left behind a place of slaughter and death but, honestly, that is what she always meant. A fatherless girl with a gun. A predator playing the part of a prey. She felt sympathy for no one. She meant her outfit to be a statement and a promise.<br>
            Her name is Lily Brook<br>
            but everyone knows her as Little Red Riding Hood<br>
            and if you are a wolf<br>
            she is coming for you.<br>
